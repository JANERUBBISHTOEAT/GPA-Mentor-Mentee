# GPA Mentor & Mentee Program

Program Period: May 2022  
Technical Director: [Zheyuan Wei](https://github.com/JANERUBBISHTOEAT)

*This repository is been modified when uploading, for it contains personal information of the mentees and mentors. The information has been removed after the program is over.*

*The only purpose of this repository is to provide a reference for the future GPA Mentee & Mentor Program.*

*If you find the program is difficult to use, that is because it is not general enough. It was designed for the specific program in 2022.*

*The repository will be updated in the future to make it more general.*
